# Python Workflow Definition 
Workflow interoperability for workflows in materials science, currently supported workflow engines:
* [aiida-workgraph](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-workgraph)
* [jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) 
* [pyiron_base](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_base)

The main components of the Python Workflow Definition are:
* [Documentation :books:](https://pythonworkflow.github.io)
* [Python Package :package:](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/python-workflow-definition)
* [Template Repository :truck:](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/example-workflow)

The Python Workflow Definition is demonstrated on three example workflows:
* [example-workflow](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/example-workflow)
* [NFDI4Ing-workflow](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/NFDI4Ing-workflow)
* [quantum-espresso-bulk-modulus-workflow](https://github.com/pythonworkflow/quantum-espresso-bulk-modulus-workflow)
